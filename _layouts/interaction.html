					<p>I use interaction design to explore how digital interfaces and technologies translate, represent and mediate knowledge about the world. Exploring the translatability between physical systems, their ranges and their systems of protocols, conventions and represenation correspondance, I seek to engage participants in expoloring in a gesture based  manner how those translations operate, and ultimately how they can be defined, hacked and created anew, with the purpose to convey the message of what this means in the politics of who decides the operability and what is possible between interfaces, information, and us as agents in these processes of meaning and agreement. </p>

					<p class="caption"> [des]encuentros (transl. [mis]encounters) is an intervention design for a theater, originally designed for Espacio Odeón in Bogotá, Colombia, a 1940's modernist theater in ruins now turned contemporary art exhibition and research center. The piece inquires around the concept of the digital representation of bodies and identities and how their encounter or dissolution in digital space resolves in the ephemeral or the transcendent.</p>
